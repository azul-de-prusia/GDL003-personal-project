# Fingertip

## Preamble

As an illustrator who works with traditional techniques I had noticed that at some point you have the need or concern to venture into digital techniques, which usually leads you to handle image editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator or Corel Draw, for example. And that is fine but you realize that it is complicated to make with a mouse the strokes that you would naturally do with a pencil or a brush. There are computer boards that make that task much easier, but they are expensive and you really do not want to invest in something you are still not sure if you will like it or if you will have satisfactory results. 
I can relate, and I´ve seen in the same case several of my friends that also use to work on traditional techiques.

## Introduction

As I´ve noticed a problem at this point, I want to propose a solution for the exact phase when a traditional artist getting into digital techniques with a free software that runs on touch devices to improve the experience of drawing without a mouse and without an expensive accesory.
It may not have all the advantages of using a Photoshop like software, it´s actually more like the old paint but you can do your sketches of the things that comes to your mind using only your celphone or a tablet and most important: now you can draw using your fingers or a pen for mobile.

## Learning objectives
With this project I will learn how to add touch events in Javascript and the use of canvas with HTML5 by developing an usefull app for drawing on mobile devices.

## General considerartions

The final product will be finished within 3 sprints of work.
